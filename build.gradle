/* Project version drives things like:
• values in the /public/version endpoint, and via this, the link to the 
  Github version on the "About" page
• docker image tag 

This sets the project version using the "git describe" command, working off
of the latest tag that matches "raido-v-*". 
Set env variable RAIDO_PROJECT_VERSION to something if running in an 
environment where Git is unavailable (e.g. AWS CodePipeline that works off of 
the .zip file instead of doing a clone).

If you're working without Git and don't know what version you're building and 
just really want to get Gradle running, set the value to "unknown" or something.  

See release-process.md for example git commands.
