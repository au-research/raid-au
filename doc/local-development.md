# Local build/development pre-requisites


* [JDK 17](./doc/adr/2022-07-21_jdk-platform.md)
  * The specific version we use for deployment is declared in the api-svc
  [dockerfile](https://github.com/au-research/raido/blob/main/api-svc/docker/src/main/docker/Dockerfile#L9)
  * We use the Amazon Corretto JDK, but any version 17+ JDK should work
  * There are many ways to install JDK's depending on your environment
    * one simple way is to download a simple zip file and keep it local to your
    environment.  You can also download installation packages, or use your 
    local system's package deployment method.
* [Node.js 16](./doc/adr/2022-07-21_nodejs-platform.md)
  * https://nodejs.org/en/download/


* Postgres 14
  * The database doesn't *have* to be installed locally, if you already have a
  postgres DB instance somewhere - you could use that if you wanted.
  * For Windows dev environments, we generally run Postgres in a Docker 
    container because it's just easier to install Docker-desktop and then 
  run a container. 
 

* Docker (optional)
  * To do basic development, you might not need Docker.
  * On Windows, the simplest approach is to use Docker-desktop: 
  https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/
  * It's often installed on dev environments for convenience though, e.g.
  running a postgres container.
  * It is necessary to have a local docker installation if you're developing
  /deploying Dockerfile scripts (api-svc, etc.)


# Local development setup

## Create database

Database [readme](../api-svc/db/readme.md) section "Running a local DB for 
development".

## Configure build scripts to know about your database

Database [readme](../api-svc/db/readme.md) section "Configuring 
`api-svc-db.gradle`".

## Create Database schema

Follow the api-svc [readme](../api-svc/readme.md) section "Running for local 
development".

## Configure api-svc

Follow the spring [readme](../api-svc/spring/readme.md) section "Configuring 
`api-svc-env.properties`".

## Run the api-svc

Follow the spring [readme](../api-svc/spring/readme.md) sections 
"Running `Api.main()` from IDE" or "Running `Api.main()` from command line".

## Run the development Node.js web server

Follow the app-client [readme](../app-client/readme.md) sections
"Running a local Node.js server in IDEA" or 
"Running a local Node.js server from command line".
