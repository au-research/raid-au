# `Raido` vs `RAiD Service` vs `RAiD`

When you see these terms in this codebase:

* `Raido`, `raido` - refers to the software codebase that implements
  our "local" RAiD service for the Oceania region.
  * It's a "codename" for the software project and not intended to be publicly
    visible.
  * The term should not be used in the UI or other user-visible places.

* `RAiD service` - in customer/user communications, we always refer to the
  "RAiD service" or "ARDC RAiD service" when talking about the service we
  provide to our customers that is based on the Raido software (hosted in AWS).
  * The `RAiD service` is operated and maintained by the ARDC in our
    capacity as one of the (hopefully many) "registration agency" providers.
  * The `RAiD service` is located in and primarily intended for customers in
    the Oceania region.

* `RAiD`, `RAID`, `Raid`, `raid` - refers to the "global" RAiD ISO standard and
  supporting global infrastructure (i.e. `raid.org`), being operated and
  maintained by ARDC in our capacity as the ISO standard "registration
  authority".
  * note that `raid.org` does not exist yet, and when it does, the software will
    live in a separate repository
