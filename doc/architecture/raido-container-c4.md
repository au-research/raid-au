This is a [C4 container diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C4_model), 
generated using [PlantUML](https://plantuml.com/).
The source for this diagram is at
[raido-container-c4.puml](./raido-container-c4.puml).
It is dynamically generated (from the `main` branch), via the plantuml.com 
public web service, see this 
[StackOverflow example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/32771815/924597).

Note that we are only just learning about C4 modelling and the diagram above
likely mis-uses the C4 constructs - this diagram is very much a work in 
progress.

Maintainers: there's a decent 
[PlantUML plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/7017-plantuml-integration) 
to help with writing diagrams, 
note that it is not maintained by JetBrains.
Also, I think non-Windows users may have to install PlantUML locally.
