See [2022-07-21_adr.md](./2022-07-21_adr.md)


## Guidelines

Filename: `<iso date>_<name>.md`

Initially, have the date is when it was first proposed (added to repo).
When decision is final, change the filename date to that date.
After decision is final, change the decision by adding a new ADR, with a new 
date. Can be a different name if you want, just add links to the files.
