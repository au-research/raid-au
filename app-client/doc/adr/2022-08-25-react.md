### Use React framework

* Status: final
* Who:  finalised by STO
* When: finalised on 2022-08-25
* Related: no related ADRs


# Decision

Use React framework


# Context

STO: This decision was already made before I joined the project, but I support
it strongly.


# Consequences

* need to pay attention to performance / re-rendering
  * need to learn the tooling to support diagnosing these issues 
* since React is a view library, not an application framework
  * decisions need to be made about how to do various things like routing, 
server communications, etc.
