# Decision

Use custom locaiton hooks for routing.


# Context

## STO opinion

The obvious choice is the react-router.
But I don't like react-router.

* They have a lot of breaking changes frequently,
  and don't usually have much of a migration path - they just tell you to
  re-write.
* It has poor Typescript support
* It's over-complicated and supports many features we don't need 

In future, consider https://tanstack.com/router/v1.  As at 2023-02-23, it's 
beta and I don't want to consider it yet.  But it appears to have good typing
support and we're already using their query stuff (react-query is 
tanStack-query).

# Consequences / Implications

* Need to read the code to understand routing
* No community to turn to ask questions
