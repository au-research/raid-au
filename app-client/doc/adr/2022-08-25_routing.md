# Decision

Use custom locaiton hooks for routing.


# Context

## STO opinion

The obvious choice is the react-router.
But I don't like react-router.

* They have alot sof breaking changes frequently,
  and don't usually have much of a migration path - they just tell you to
  re-write.
* It has poor Typescript support
* It's over-complicated and supports many features we don't need 


# Consequences / Implications

* Need to read the code to undersand routing
* No community to turn to ask questions
