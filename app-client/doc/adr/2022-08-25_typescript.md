# Decision

Use statically typed Typescript code where possible for implementing the 
app-client.


# Context

## STO opinion

This decision was already made before I joined the project.

But I agree with it strongly - I prefer static typing over dynamic typing.


# Consequences / Implications

* Node.JS installation becomes a pre-requisite for this repo
