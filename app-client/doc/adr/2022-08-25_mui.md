# Decision

Use the MUI component library for writing UI components.

# Context

## STO opinion

Bootstrap / JQuery are old, don't work well with React.

Using a cohesive component library implementing a full-fledged design language
lets developers worry less about design issues (we don't have budget for 
a dedicated UX developer)

Also reduces developer need to deal HTML/CSS a lot. Mostly, we can rely on 
MUI to look after this stuff for us.


# Consequences / Implications

* Need to learn the MUI component library
  * particularly the styling solution
