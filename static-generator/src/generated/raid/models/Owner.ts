/**
 * RAID v2 API
 * This file is where all the endpoint paths are defined, it\'s the \"top level\' of the OpenAPI definition that links all the different files together. The `3.0` in the filename refers to this file being based on OpenAPI 3.0  as opposed to OpenAPI 3.1, which the tooling doesn\'t support yet. The `2.0.0` in the version field refers to the fact that there\'s already  a `1.0.0` used for the legacy RAiD application. Note that swagger ui doesn\'t currently work with our spec,  see https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-ui/issues/7724 But the spec works fine with openapi-generator tooling. 
 *
 * The version of the OpenAPI document: 2.0.0
 * Contact: contact@raid.org
