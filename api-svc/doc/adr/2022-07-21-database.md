### Use Postgres

* Status: final
* Who:  finalised by STO
* When: finalised on 2022-07-21
* Related: no related ADRs


# Decision


Use Postgres, managed by AWS via RDS product.

Use Postgres features for speed of implementation and operational performance, 
without worrying about encapsulating/abstracting for different DB choices.

## STO opinion

Decision was before my time, but I agree with it.


# Context

After discussion with JBE/NSI - running on ARDC infra is a non-goal, so no 
need to worry about MySQL specifically.  ARDC DevOps won't be operating it, we 
pay AWS to look after upgrades, backups, uptime, resourcing, etc.


# Consequences

* expensive to port to a different db, see 
  [postgres-specific-features.md](../postgres-specific-features.md)
