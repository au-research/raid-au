# Decision

Use Docker for running the api-svc in all production and pre-production 
enviornments.


# Context

Having a standard format for declaring how the api-svc is installed and run
by default.

This is purely a packaging and deployment choice - Docker is not intended as a
security boundary.


Long-term, it's envisaged that the api-svc will be run in a "managed" capacity
via some AWS-maintained service: EKS, ECS, App Runner, etc.
Using the docker format will allow us to transition to the chosen services 
with relative ease.

Short-term, we run the api-svc with a simple shell script, and it's run in a 
"one container per node" fasion, where the nodes are managed by an AWS 
auto-scaling group.

Additionally, as the software grows and separate services need to be 
factored out - it is intended we will use docker for packaging and deployment
of those services as well.
