Run in DEMO environment on 2023-06-12, by STO.

Some of the resource graphs and metric graphs can be found on the internal 
wiki: https://ardc.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/RAID/pages/291471397/2023-06-12+load-test

## Summary

Load-test execution:
* simultaneous users: 3000 
* overall HTTP requests/second: 330

Note that the times above include external system time. 
For example,  the mint 99th percentile says "2.751" seconds, but 2 seconds of 
that is time spent waiting for external system calls: 
* APIDs call to mint handle
* APIDs call to set url
* validate ORCID
* validate ROR


## Resource usage

The EC2 console and ECS console show that we used up to 70%-%90 CPU on average.

The RDS console shows:
* CPU: steady at just under 50% usage
* Network throughput (bytes/second) os.network.tx.avg - steady at 11M


## Connection usage

The api-svc nodes all acquired their connection max early in the test:  
20 each for 6 nodes - 120 connections.

In the CloudWatch custom metrics, our connection pool metrics showed only one
small spike for connection acquisitions.

The `hikaricp.connections.pending.value` spiked up to `29` for a single data 
point.

The `hikaricp.connections.acquire.avg`spiked to `40` ms for two data points.

The spikes happened in time, so I do think one or more nodes spent some time
acquiring DB connections.  But the pending count recovered quickly and it 
didn't happen again for the rest of the test.


## System under test

Version tested: raido-v-1.2-80-gbd76f1c

This is the production version of the ap-svc deployed as version `1.2`, plus:
* transaction fix to not hold transactions open during external calls
* added index for the list-raids endpoint 

These changes are expected to be deployed to production as part of 
version `1.3`.
