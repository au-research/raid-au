### Use Spring Framework Milestone/Candidate releases

* Status: final
* Who:  finalised by STO

# Decision

Use Spring Framework Milestone/Candidate releases

Downgrade to 5.x line if it causes too many issues.


# Context

Want to use Spring 6 because it's minimum JDK 17 (which aligns with the
rest of the project) and so we won't have to worry about a major Spring upgrade
for a long time (especially considering the Servlet 5.0 upgrade involving the
use of the new jakarta package).

Note that SpringSource released M5 on the 16th, which wasn't on the roadmap.


# Consequences

* could cause issues - there might be frameworks not yet working with Spring 6
  * example: libs still built on servlet <5 with no upgrade ready (Auth0, etc.)
  * mitigation: thriving libs will have upgrades soon, if a lib isn't currently
    working on SErvlet 5 support - we probably shouldnt' be using it anyway
* less IDE support for direct spring usage instead of spring-boot
  * example: IDEA doesn't even have a direct "Spring" concept any more
  * mitigation: Raido should not be built assuming specific IDE usage
    * using eclipse/netbeans is allowed / expected
    * some folks may even use VSCode or other low-integration IDEs
