<!-- this is the default logging setup for Raido runnin in a docker container,
in an AWS environment.
The timestamp is actually even shorter than local dev, because it's not 
all that useful in a cloudwatch environment.  The cloudwatch "timestamp" value
is not this value, it's the value that the cloudwatch agent on the ec2 instance
recorded.  The logback time is more accurate, but the cloudwatch timestamp
is what you'll use to query against with cloudwatch log insights, etc.
