### Running funtional tests

You must have a "raido" database, as per [db/readme.md](../../../db/readme.md)
and the api-svc must be configured as per [api-svc/readme.md](../../readme.md).

The intTests will pick up that api-svc-env.properties configuration, so you 
shouldn't need any extra config by default.
