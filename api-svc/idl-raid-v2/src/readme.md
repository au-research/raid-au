# Concepts 

## "Raid" metadata vs "Raid AU" metadata

In general, and in this document specifically:
* "Raid" refers to the concept of the global RAiD ISO standard and its
  associated metadata.
* "Raid AU" is the ARDC's implementation of the Raid standard for Oceania region.
  It is expected that there will be many separately operated Raid 
  implementations which will likely support different region-appropriate 
  customise metadata schema.
