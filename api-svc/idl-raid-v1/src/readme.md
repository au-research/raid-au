`raid-v1-1-0.yaml` is copied from the original stored in the 
[doc](../doc/readme.md) area and then manually chopped down to be only what
Raido needs to implement to keep the UQ@RDM API calls working (nobody else
was using the legacy API). 

This entire API is **deprecated**.  Only RDM@UQ are able to use it and they 
are expected to upgrade to some version of the stable API at some point 
(defined in  
[raido-openapi-3.0.yaml](../../idl-raid-v2/src/raido-openapi-3.0.yaml).
